Praxis II -- Bonsai soil moisture monitoring and watering system

## TODO

1. Integrate the current Bonsense app with existing CoreBluetooth test

2. Fix BLE connection and characteristic read/write with Raspberry Pi Bleak client

3. Finalise the data interface for moisture sensor data

4. Calibrate the moisture sensor (potentially using ML/statistical methods)

5. Wait for dataset for smartphone photo and transfer learn for bonsai soil

6. Deployment using CoreML to the real-time photo prediction

## Optional

1. Test NIR spectroscopy (need NIR source and diffraction spectroscope)

2. Enhance the overall UI/UX of the app

3. Fix the camera view so that the camera is displayed in the box, not a popup where you take a photo

4. Implement AR feature to direclty recognize and display a moisture level / alert tag on top of the bonsai for maximum convenience (UX!!)

5. Implement water level data storage and analytics (with SwiftData)
